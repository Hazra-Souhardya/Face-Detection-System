# Face-Detection-System
Project - Face Detection System

Face Detection System detects face of a person using a camera/webcam and helps to identify the person.
After detecting the face it generates an excel(.csv) file.
The file keeps the records of faces detected with time and then saves the file with name on which date the face was detected.
It can be used as attendance marking system in that way too.

It uses OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision) library with Python.
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.
